Goals:
	Make Kjas tech less of an informaitonal overload
	Slightly slow the Kjas early game and speed up their lategame
	Add in variability to how the Kjas plan their tech while keeping it in a reasonable bounds of randomness for the Kjas
		(i.e. minimal amounts of input randomness)
	Increase the Kjas interaction with aliens
	Preserve the general tech tree

Kjas techs turned into cards
	Advanced versions of the tech are on the bottom (flipside)
	Advanced techs automatically flip to their advanced research side if the basic side is completed
Military and economic cards and hands (hidden)
1 military, 1 economic, and 1 wild action per turn
At the end of the tech phase, the Kjas may discard as many cards as they would like to draw that many of the same type. 
Deck is shuffled if the Kjas player goes to draw and there are no cards. 
Techs are invented if they have enough points on them to invent them at the end of the tech phase

Each action can:
	- Draw a card from a research deck.
	- Play a card you did not draw this turn from your hand into active research
	- Put 2 tech points on a card that hasn't had an action performed on it this turn
	- (wild only) put one tech point on a card that has had an action performed on it this turn
Expertise:
	- Cards have expertise requirements that must be met in order to play or put points into them
	- Most cards grant expertise. 
	- Any expertise the Kjas have beyond the requirements reduce the tech's cost by 1 per
